---

### Environment

##### Qt Online Installer

Qt online installer is **no longer needed**.

##### MSYS2

Install with default settings.  

Install these packages:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-pkgconf
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-base mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-tools
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-poppler mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-poppler-qt6
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-SDL2
```

**For ARM64 systems:** Replace `x86_64` with `aarch64` in the commands above, and use `clangarm64` instead of `clang64` in the paths below. 

##### Path

Add this directory to Path. If you have an arm64 system, replace the paths from clang64 to clangarm64. 

```cmd
C:\msys64\clang64\bin
```

and then restart your PC.

##### CMake Setup

In the CMake Tools extension of Visual Studio Code, find the `Cmake: Cmake Path` option and change it to `C:\msys64\clang64\bin\cmake.exe` .
Add this directory to Path. As always, if you have an arm64 system, replace the paths from clang64 to clangarm64. 

---

### Build

Run `compile.ps1`to build SpeedyNote. The complete build is in `build`.You may want to delete some temporary files that CMake generated. For arm64 builds, you need to run `compile.ps1 -arm64` instead.
